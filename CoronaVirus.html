What is Corona virus? :
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause disease in animals and humans. It is known that a number of corona viruses in humans cause respiratory infections that range from common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The recently discovered Coronavirus causes the Coronavirus disease Covid-19.

<center><h1>What is Covid-19 disease?</h1></center>
<p>



Covid-19 disease is an infectious disease caused by the recently discovered corona virus.

There was no knowledge of the existence of this virus and this emerging disease before the outbreak of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.
</p>
<br><br><br>


<center><h1>What are the symptoms of Covid-19 disease? :</h1></center>
   <p>


The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue and a dry cough. Some patients may suffer from aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected without showing any symptoms and without feeling ill.

Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.

 

The severity of the disease is more severe in approximately one person out of every 6 people who develop Covid-19 infection, as they suffer from



Breathing difficulty. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart disease or diabetes are more likely to develop severe disease.
</p>


<center><h1>How does Covid-19 disease spread?</h1></center>
  <p>


People can become infected with Covid-19 disease from other people who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets that are scattered from the nose or mouth when a person with Covid-19 disease coughs or sneezes. These droplets fall on the objects and surfaces surrounding the person. Other people can then become infected with Covid-19 disease when they come into contact with these objects or surfaces and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also get Covid-19 disease if they breathe in the droplets that come out of the person with the disease as they cough or exhale. Therefore, it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from the sick person. WHO is assessing ongoing research on ways to spread COVID-19 disease and will continue to publish its latest findings.
  </p>

  <br><br><br>


<center><h1>Can the virus that causes Covid-19 disease be transmitted through the air?</h1></center>
  <p>


Studies conducted to this day indicate that the virus that causes Covid-19 disease is transmitted primarily through contact with respiratory droplets, not through the air. See the answer to the previous question: "How does Covid-19 disease spread?"
  </p>

  <br><br><br>

<center><h1>How long does the incubation period for Covid-19 disease take?</h1></center>
   <p>

The term "incubation period" refers to the period from infection with the virus to the onset of symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for Covid-19 disease range from one to 14 days, and it usually lasts five days. These estimates will be updated as more data becomes available.
